While this is a valuable security step and a necessary measure to protect our customers, itâ€™s equally important to clarify that this does not change the established End-of-Support (EOS) timeline. IMPORTANT: SonicWall strongly recommends that users of the SMA 100 series products (SMA 210, 410, and 500v) upgrade to the 10.2.2.2-92sv version. Additionally, the threat intelligence report from Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) highlights potential risk of using older versions of SMA100 firmware. We strongly recommend that all organizations using SMA 100 Series appliances review and implement the security measures outlined in the KB article linked below. https://www.sonicwall.com/support/notices/urgent-advisory-for-addressing-rootkits-and-other-critical-vulnerabilities-in-sonicwall-sma-100-series-appliances/250730071322160 CVE: N/A Last updated: Sept. 29, 2025, 11:58 a.m.""""","""""",""""""
