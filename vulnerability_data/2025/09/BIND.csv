In BIND 9 you can configure a DNSSEC Key and Signing Policy (KASP), allowing you to specify all DNSSEC signing behavior in one place. This is the same approach as with OpenDNSSEC. Requirements First of all, OpenSSL 3.0 or higher is required. Older versions relied on so-called engines to perform cryptographic operations. The PKCS#11 engine was used to interface with an HSM ke ...""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""","""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""",""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Reasons include: Minimized risk of impact to DNS services due to other applications consuming server resources (perhaps due to an attack on those services or application error). Conversely, minimized risk to other applications as a result of BIND consuming all system or network resources. Reduced likelihood of unauthorized access to the DNS server (e.g. via a code defect and root access exploit made possible via another application). Improved ab ...""""","""""",""""""
