We employ rigorous testing and validation methodologies to enable swift identification, patching, and disclosure of vulnerabilities in collaboration with the broader security ecosystem. Our priority is to provide responsible and transparent communication to our customers, so they are empowered to defend their environments. In recent months, we have intensified our internal scanning, manual exploitation and testing capabilities, and have also made enhancements to our responsible disclosure process so that we promptly discover and address potential issues, and so that our customers are best equipped to take action. Ivanti releases standard security patches on the second Tuesday of every month. For many of our customers, the predictable schedule facilitates better planning and management of IT resources, allowing them to allocate time and personnel efficiently for the timely updates. Today, fixes have been released for the Ivanti solutions detailed below. It is important for customers to know: We have no evidence of any of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. These vulnerabilities do not impact any other Ivanti products. More information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions on how to remediate the issues can be found in these Security Advisories: Ivanti Cloud Service Application Ivanti Neurons for MDM Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure and Secure Access Client Our Support team is always available to help customers and partners should they have any questions.
