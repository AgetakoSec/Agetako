Our vulnerability management program is central to our commitment to maintaining secure products. Our philosophy is simple: discovering and communicating vulnerabilities, and sharing that information with defenders, is not an indication of weakness; rather it is evidence of rigorous scrutiny and a proactive vulnerability management program. By aggressively seeking to identify and address vulnerabilities, our aim is to get ahead of threat actors to ensure our customers can take the steps needed to protect their environments. We believe that responsible transparency helps protect our customers, and that CVE disclosures are an essential and effective tool to communicate software vulnerabilities. The purpose of assigning a CVE is to provide a beacon to security teams and signal the need for urgent updates. To that end, today Ivanti is disclosing vulnerabilities in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) and Neurons for MDM. More information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions on how to remediate the issues can be found in these Security Advisories: Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) Ivanti Neurons for MDM In addition, Ivanti has issued a Security Advisory for Ivanti Endpoint Manager , which provides mitigation options for vulnerabilities disclosed October 7, 2025. It is important for customers to know: We have no evidence of any of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. These vulnerabilities do not impact any other Ivanti solutions. Our Support team is always available to help customers and partners should they have any questions. Cases can be logged via the Success portal (login credentials required).

In versions below 1.3, Mermaid (which is used to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) to be exploited. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server. GitHub created this CVE on their behalf. The documented Visual Studio updates incorporate updates in Mermaid which address this vulnerability.

CVE-2025-0033 is a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors using Secure Encrypted Virtualization – Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). It involves a race condition during Reverse Map Table (RMP) initialization that could allow a malicious or compromised hypervisor to modify RMP entries before they are locked, potentially impacting the integrity of SEV-SNP guest memory. This issue does not expose plaintext data or secrets and requires privileged control of the hypervisor to exploit. Across Azure Confidential Computing products, multiple security guardrails are in place to prevent host compromise, combining isolation, integrity verification and continuous monitoring. All host operations follow audited and approved management pathways, with administrative access strictly controlled, limited and logged. Together, these protections reduce the risk of host compromise or unauthorized memory manipulation, helping ensure that confidential workloads and customer VMs maintain their confidentiality and integrity on Azure hosts.""""","""""",""""""

You may be using a Microsoft app or playing a Microsoft game that should be uninstalled until an update is available. We are working to update games and applications that are potentially affected by this Unity vulnerability. In most cases, you can stay safe by ensuring your games and applications are up to date and Microsoft Defender is running on your device. If you have downloaded a vulnerable game or app (see list below) on one of the following platforms, you could be at risk: * Android * Windows * Linux (Desktop) * Linux (embedded) * MacOS We have confirmed the following are not impacted: * Xbox consoles * Xbox Cloud Gaming * iOS * HoloLens **Recommended Next Steps:** **For Developers**: Unity has made a fix available to developers. Organizations who believe that they have an app or game that might be impacted should reference Unity guidance and update their apps/games as soon as possible. You can learn more from Unity here. **For Players and Customers**: Microsoft security and game development teams are working to update any game or application that is potentially affected by this Unity vulnerability. If a Microsoft-owned game or application is not listed and you have installed all available updates, no further action is required. For customers who have automatic updates enabled, fixes will be deployed as they become available. If you have automatic updates turned off, please check to see if you have any updates available for your downloaded apps and games and install the latest update on your device. Customers who have an impacted app or game installed (see below list) are encouraged to take these steps: * Temporarily uninstall any impacted Microsoft apps or games until an update is available. For more guidance on how to uninstall, please see the FAQs below. * Use an up-to-date version of Microsoft Defender to detect and block attempts to exploit this vulnerability. * Follow guidance from Unity or your platform provider. * Microsoft-owned games and apps affected by this vulnerability and their requisite updates are documented in the Security Updates Table. **For Microsoft Mesh Apps Users** In response to this CVE that is affecting applications built with the Unity Gaming Engine Editor (version 2017.1 or later), Microsoft has released a required security update for the Microsoft Mesh PC applications. We strongly encourage all users with the Microsoft Mesh apps installed on their devices to promptly update to the latest version of these apps, version 5.2513.3.0 or greater. If you have automatic updates enabled for these apps on all devices, no further action is required. While we do not expect this to affect the functionality of any previously-scheduled events in Microsoft Mesh, use of the immersive spaces in Microsoft Teams meetings, or immersive events in Microsoft Teams, users will be required to update the Mesh PC apps before joining newly scheduled events in Mesh.
