Our vulnerability management program is central to our commitment to maintaining secure products. Our philosophy is simple: discovering and communicating vulnerabilities, and sharing that information with defenders, is not an indication of weakness; rather it is evidence of rigorous scrutiny and a proactive vulnerability management program. By aggressively seeking to identify and address vulnerabilities, our aim is to get ahead of threat actors to ensure our customers can take the steps needed to protect their environments. We believe that responsible transparency helps protect our customers, and that CVE disclosures are an essential and effective tool to communicate software vulnerabilities. The purpose of assigning a CVE is to provide a beacon to security teams and signal the need for urgent updates. To that end, today Ivanti is disclosing vulnerabilities in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) and Neurons for MDM. More information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions on how to remediate the issues can be found in these Security Advisories: Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) Ivanti Neurons for MDM In addition, Ivanti has issued a Security Advisory for Ivanti Endpoint Manager , which provides mitigation options for vulnerabilities disclosed October 7, 2025. It is important for customers to know: We have no evidence of any of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. These vulnerabilities do not impact any other Ivanti solutions. Our Support team is always available to help customers and partners should they have any questions. Cases can be logged via the Success portal (login credentials required).

In versions below 1.3, Mermaid (which is used to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) to be exploited. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server. GitHub created this CVE on their behalf. The documented Visual Studio updates incorporate updates in Mermaid which address this vulnerability.

CVE-2025-0033 is a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors using Secure Encrypted Virtualization – Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). It involves a race condition during Reverse Map Table (RMP) initialization that could allow a malicious or compromised hypervisor to modify RMP entries before they are locked, potentially impacting the integrity of SEV-SNP guest memory. This issue does not expose plaintext data or secrets and requires privileged control of the hypervisor to exploit. Across Azure Confidential Computing products, multiple security guardrails are in place to prevent host compromise, combining isolation, integrity verification and continuous monitoring. All host operations follow audited and approved management pathways, with administrative access strictly controlled, limited and logged. Together, these protections reduce the risk of host compromise or unauthorized memory manipulation, helping ensure that confidential workloads and customer VMs maintain their confidentiality and integrity on Azure hosts.""""","""""",""""""
