# UpdateVulnerability

## Logging

The application now provides more detailed logging.  
For each site, the logger records:

* Titles and links of retrieved articles.
* The number of articles fetched.
* The local time when data was last updated.

Logs are written to `vulnerability_logger.log` and printed to the console.
